Welcome to my GitHub profile! Greetings! I'm Karthigan Uthayan, a Mechatronics Engineer at the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about technology, particularly in the fields of Machine Learning, AI, Robotics, and more. I'm driven by a deep curiosity to shape the future by solving complex problems and transforming ideas into reality.

With a strong foundation in machine learning and programming, I aim to push the boundaries of what's achievable. I firmly believe that Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks are powerful tools capable of revolutionizing industries and enhancing lives.

My work in robotics explores the tangible aspects of AI, where I create intelligent systems that interact with and adapt to their surroundings. Whether it's designing algorithms, building models, or tinkering with hardware, my goal is to develop technology that makes a meaningful impact. Here some key aspects I have gotten familiar with!
